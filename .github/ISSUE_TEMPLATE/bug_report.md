4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots / Logs**
If applicable, add screenshots or copy/paste log output. Include build output if relevant (e.g. `make` output, linker warnings). If the ROM was built, include the `pokefirered.gba` SHA1 or build timestamp.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**

Add any other context about the problem here (mods applied, manual edits, custom scripts used). If you ran build tools that modified the repo (e.g. regenerated assets), mention that.

<!--
Helpful notes for the reporter (not shown after issue creation):
- Please run `git status` to verify you are reporting from a clean working tree
- If the problem only happens after running build tools, include the exact commands you ran
- Attach `pokefirered.map` or `pokefirered.elf` if linker/map errors occur
-->
